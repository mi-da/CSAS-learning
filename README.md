# Learning in Collective Self-adaptive Systems
**Collective self-adaptive systems (CSAS)** are distributed and interconnected systems composed of multiple agents that can perform complex tasks. By providing individual agents with learning capabilities, CSAS can cope with challenges related to distributed sensing and decision-making, and operate in uncertain environments. Although learning has been explored in many CSAS applications, selecting suitable learning techniques and models remains a significant challenge.

# Goal
The goal of our systematic literature review is to understand the state of practice on how learning is employed in CSAS. To this end, we investigate related research that involve the development of CSAS employing learning techniques. We are particularly interested in the studies employing learning in CSAS to enable agents to adapt their behavior when encountering scenarios unanticipated at design time.

# Research Questions

- **RQ1**: What are the characteristics of the described CSAS?  
- **RQ2**: What is the purpose of learning?  
- **RQ3**: Which are the selected learning techniques?
- **RQ4**: What are the triggers for updating learning models?

# Research Method
Our investigation is made by means of a systematic literature review (SLR) of 52 related research papers out of 215 preliminary candidates.

# Documents
**Replication package**: The following [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tkX0cTYFzkTWq-KWRimPkrowaW_ZvoRs) points to the replication document.

**Collected Data**: The following [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tD9yaWa7JfokEHNGdw5sMem09e-y5FuAhfuI7Av2VYw/edit#gid=1392946669) points to the analysed literature and corresponding data collected in a Google sheet.

# Results
Based on the analysis of the selected studies, we report here our findings.

## Application Domain
The most dominant applications are cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as robotics, sensor systems and smart energy applications.
This is inline with the increasing interest in CPS, especially in the area of self-adaptive systems. Network-based applications
are the second most explored domain. Other applications include traffic scenarios, cooperative games, and market applications. Finally, four studies describe the solution to learning in CSAS using abstract multi-agent organisational models but do not report any concrete applications.
