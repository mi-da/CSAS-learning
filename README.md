# Learning in Collective Self-adaptive Systems
**Collective self-adaptive systems (CSAS)** are distributed and interconnected systems composed of multiple agents that can perform complex tasks. By providing individual agents with learning capabilities, CSAS can cope with challenges related to distributed sensing and decision-making, and operate in uncertain environments. Although learning has been explored in many CSAS applications, selecting suitable learning techniques and models remains a significant challenge.

# Goal
The goal our study is understanding the state of practice of how learning is employed in CSAS. To this end, we investigate related research that involves the development of CSAS that use learning models to enable agents to adapt their behaviour when encountering scenarios unanticipated at design time.

# Research Questions

- **RQ1**: What are the characteristics of the described CSAS?  
- **RQ2**: What is the purpose of learning?  
- **RQ3**: Which are the selected learning techniques?
- **RQ4**: What are the triggers for updating learning models?

# Research Method
Our investigation is made by means of a systematic literature review of 52 related research papers out of 215 candidates.
