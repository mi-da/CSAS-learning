# Learning in Collective Self-adaptive Systems
Collective self-adaptive systems (CSAS) are distributed and interconnected systems composed of multiple agents that can perform complex tasks including environmental data collection, search, rescue operations and discovery of natural resources. By providing individual agents with learning capabilities, CSAS can cope with challenges related to distributed sensing and decision-making, and operate in uncertain environments. This unique characteristic of CSAS enables the collective to exhibit robust behaviour while achieving system-wide and agent-specific goals. Although learning has been explored in many CSAS applications, selecting suitable learning techniques and models remains a significant challenge that is heavily influenced by expert knowledge. We address this gap by performing a multi-dimensional analysis of the current state-of-the-art CSAS with learning capabilities. Based on this analysis, we introduce a 3D framework that illustrates the learning aspects of CSAS considering the dimensions of \emph{autonomy}, \emph{knowledge access}, and \emph{selfishness}, and facilitate the selection of learning techniques and models. Finally, using example applications from this analysis, we derive open challenges and highlight the need for research on collaborative, resilient and privacy-aware mechanisms for CSAS. 

# Goal
The goal our study is understanding the state of practice of how learning is employed in CSAS. To this end, we investigate related research that involves the development of CSAS that use learning models to enable agents to adapt their behaviour when encountering scenarios unanticipated at design time.

# Research Questions

- **RQ1**: What are the characteristics of the described CSAS?  
- **RQ2**: What is the purpose of learning?  
- **RQ3**: Which are the selected learning techniques?
- **RQ4**: What are the triggers for updating learning models?

# Research Method
Our investigation is made by means of a systematic literature review of 52 related research papers out of 215 candidates
